# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R3 Day 4: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** This was fun - althought this code along had a Sandbox link, I really couldn't figure out how it was supposed to work. So I plunged back into my Git Bash shell and tried to make a go of it. I forgot that at some point I set up SSH on Github, so I spent some time solving that too. I felt very smart!

**Thoughts:** I am a problem solver - remember this.

### R3 Day 3: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I don't want to jinx it, but this is all coming back to me! I sat down and worked in 25 minute increments, and I just keep forging ahead!

**Thoughts:** If I keep being courageous and being in action, I can continue to make progress. That may include looking things up, getting a technical coach, or taking short breaks.

### R3 Day 2: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I really enjoy the code alongs and labs for Flatiron - I really feel like I'm getting into material and not just following along. It's also a nice example of builing up or down from a design - too often I feel like I need to know everything about a finished design before I start.

**Thoughts:** As I do this work, I'm reminded of how much knowledge I already taught myself, long before I could Google (or even Yahoo or even Infoseek!) information. I TAUGHT MYSELF THIS STUFF!! Don't forget this!!

### R3 Day 1: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** So...I dropped out of Round 2. I wasn't being serious enough, and after talking with my educational coach for Flatiron, I realized I needed to be focused. Beginning today, I logged back into Flatiron, had the possibility of courage and being in action, and got started back up.

**Thoughts:** I had to stop being afraid of failing in order to move forward. In the end, the lab I had stymied at required me to do an inspect on the sample anyway so I could get the right font sizes, colors, etc. Sheesh!
