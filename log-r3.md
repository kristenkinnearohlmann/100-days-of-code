# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R3 Day 9: July 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Beater day - I worked before church, between church and the nursing home, and for 1.5 hours after the nursing home to thrash this out. 2 more chats with technical coaches, one over voice, and I think I was starting to see the madness and the method - yes, just like that. I sweated out the final problem for 30 minutes and cracked it wide open.

**Thoughts:** I am the champion!! Who appreciates the help of the technical coaches getting my brain to solve the last problem on its own.

### R3 Day 8: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Diving back into Ruby with RegEx. I read the lessons - it all made sense - then came the lab!! After the first problem solved, of 5 and with the technical coach pointing out I missed something dumb like upper and lower case letters, I rode my bike to dinner.

**Thoughts:** Now I need to put the discipline into practice of tackling tough stuff with a positive attitude!

### R3 Day 7: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I ran through a couple more CSS lessons this morning. I had planned to do more in the evening but decided sleep was a better idea.

**Thoughts:** I like this little brain break.

### R3 Day 6: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Last night, I read the additional GitHub page that Flatiron added - good stuff for having good repos! Today I started into the revised HTML path - I think I'll breeze through it even faster since I'm apparently OG with HTML (invented in 1993, I started using it in 1996 or so) and I've picked up a lot of knowledge of HTML5/CSS3 on the old track for HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying not to over-learn but also want to ensure I pick up any updates to my older knowledge. Happy to be moving along again!

### R3 Day 5: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Hit a snag - I'm trying to finish the old track HTML/CSS on Flatiron and I just hit a dead-end with the lab. I'm not really getting super clear answers on how to get what I need. Since I'll be checking in next week with my educational coach, I think I'll jump tracks to the new track of HTML/CSS until I can get a clear answer.

**Thoughts:** Even though I want to be frustrated, this is all progress. If I can get an answer before I get kicked out of my cafe haunt, I will or I will switch to the new track tomorrow. I'm couting this as work down on 100 days of code!

### R3 Day 4: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** This was fun - althought this code along had a Sandbox link, I really couldn't figure out how it was supposed to work. So I plunged back into my Git Bash shell and tried to make a go of it. I forgot that at some point I set up SSH on Github, so I spent some time solving that too. I felt very smart!

**Thoughts:** I am a problem solver - remember this.

### R3 Day 3: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I don't want to jinx it, but this is all coming back to me! I sat down and worked in 25 minute increments, and I just keep forging ahead!

**Thoughts:** If I keep being courageous and being in action, I can continue to make progress. That may include looking things up, getting a technical coach, or taking short breaks.

### R3 Day 2: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I really enjoy the code alongs and labs for Flatiron - I really feel like I'm getting into material and not just following along. It's also a nice example of builing up or down from a design - too often I feel like I need to know everything about a finished design before I start.

**Thoughts:** As I do this work, I'm reminded of how much knowledge I already taught myself, long before I could Google (or even Yahoo or even Infoseek!) information. I TAUGHT MYSELF THIS STUFF!! Don't forget this!!

### R3 Day 1: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** So...I dropped out of Round 2. I wasn't being serious enough, and after talking with my educational coach for Flatiron, I realized I needed to be focused. Beginning today, I logged back into Flatiron, had the possibility of courage and being in action, and got started back up.

**Thoughts:** I had to stop being afraid of failing in order to move forward. In the end, the lab I had stymied at required me to do an inspect on the sample anyway so I could get the right font sizes, colors, etc. Sheesh!
