# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R2 Day 22: May 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Trying out Markdown for note-taking for the first time after taking yet another tutorial. We'll see if it sticks better this time around. Already I feel like I'm rocking it out!

**Thoughts:** I'm still in the mode where I need to re-practice every couple of days.

### R2 Day 17: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Stirred myself to find a quick Ruby tutorial to start getting back on track. Fought with Git Bash for about 10 minutes before I realized that, unlike Python, you need to use IRB to do Ruby things so I finally was using the right winpty alias to try the tutorial. Promptly dumped the page trying to update VS Code :D Also looked for more Markdown tutorials so I can get more adept at it for notetaking. 

**Thoughts:** I need to work harder to find daily time to practice!

### R2 Day 7: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read history of CSS.

**Thoughts:** This was recommended by Chris DeMars that presented at TC Code Camp. There was some things I had assumed. Why did I not start working with CSS until well after 2000 if it existed in 1996??
