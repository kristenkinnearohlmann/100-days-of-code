# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First day! I read Quincy Larson's article about the challenge on Medium, and decided to go for it!

**Thoughts:** I had been working through the Learn.co curriculum for several weeks and found Ruby to be delightful. I am currently working through the HTML portion of the coursework. I had strong knowledge of HTML and CSS through about 2001 but have found I don't have a ton of catching up to do for HTML5 - yet! Semantic elements are next, and my dabbling hasn't yet strengthened my foundations but the Learn.co curriculum so far has, so I'm excited!
