# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 55: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on GSW site page. Something odd in the HTML theme the previous guy had that wouldn't allow <blockquote> to render - weird! I just wrote my own CSS class. I think I'm going to make the sections live in accordions so the content isn't so long.

**Thoughts:** As always, tweaking someone else's code is an adventure in puzzle solving.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 54: February 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Updated the School of Voiceover homepage to the Divi builder so the modules can insulate the code more. Wrestled with some custom code on MVO Weebly site.

**Thoughts:** I appreciate website CMS tools but they also sometimes get in the way of the work.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 53: February 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed how to price work as a freelance consultant, after trying to persuade the person who does the website at my part-time job to use the code I took from a tutorial to create (badly needed) drop-down menus.

**Thoughts:** I need to refine my pitch and persuasion on website topics. This will allow me to be more persuasive about why solutions should change.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 52: February 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Found a good stopping point in making the School of Voiceover homepage mobile friendly. Learned how WP defines function signatures.

**Thoughts:** The WP function signatures were really hurting my brain until a plugin developer explained it to me. It still hurts my brain but at least I understand it!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 51: February 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read more of the CSS layout tutorial and made attempt 1 to ensure the homepage of School of Voiceover was mobile friendly.

**Thoughts:** Working with WordPress is interesting - sometimes it seems like things are all too simple, and sometimes things are just clunky.

**Link to work:** [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)


### Day 50: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read through a little of a CSS layout tutorial and played with something I have cooking in one of my Codepen profiles.

**Thoughts:** CSS is so much more evolved than when I left it in 2002. I'm using every opportunity to stuff the new stuff in my brain.

**Link to work:** [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)


### Day 49: February 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finally conquered my CPT!! Take that single.php!

**Thoughts:** Whee!!!!! My brain finally made all the necessary connections to make this happen. It felt great!

**Link to work:** NA - not yet published!


### Day 48: Feburary 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Located some React tutorials.

**Thoughts:** I read that React is the current JS framework of choice. Never mind that my vanilla JS is very spotty!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 47: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Big day - I updated htaccess file for School of Voiceover and wrote a Python script to check for empty directories.

**Thoughts:** I really did these 2 things like a boss. I have to say I impressed myself with how easily I turned both out!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 46: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I finished styling menu bar prototype for Get in Gear which I hope to use on other projects too.

**Thoughts:** Although I still think there are pieces missing, the menu is working as expected.

**Link to work:** [GIG Menu Bar](https://codepen.io/callmekko/pen/zpVgNJ)


### Day 45: February 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I completed CSS and HTML styling for School of Voiceover Direction and Contact pages, Continue Statements in Automate the Boring Stuff.

**Thoughts:** It's tough for me to accept styling I don't agree with, so this was good practice.

### Day 44: February 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked on accordion tutorial and dug more for creating a specific kind of CPT.

**Thoughts:** It was great to find the accordion tutorial and follow along. I'm looking forward to the day when I can write tutorials for others!

**Link to work:** [Accordion Pen](https://codepen.io/callmekko/pen/oEEzZJ)


### Day 43: February 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I added pages to the GSW website to allow for program notes.

**Thoughts:** I want to get to the point where coming up with layouts and information organization is even more organic.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 42: February 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I did quite a lot of work on Gravity Forms, including URL parameters between forms.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting more comfortable with some of the things I'm committing to long-term memory. It makes getting simple work done much faster.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 41: February 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked on my Nav Bar pen in CodePen for GIG.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying not to be a spoiler for the guy that does the website for GIG, but I also know that a good, organized drop-down menu will make a difference to the user experience.

**Link to work:** [GIG Navbar](https://codepen.io/callmekko/pen/zpVgNJ)


### Day 40: February 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I tried a number of suggestions for populating my CPT with a Divi layout. No luck so far!

**Thoughts:** This is definitely new territory for me. Frankly, I'm kind of enjoying being stumped!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 39: February 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Skimmed tutorials and articles

**Thoughts:** When I have time for nothing else, I can at least remind myself of the journey.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 38: February 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I reviewed the algorithm from my in-trade job for allocating students into groups, worked on Gravity Form logic, implemented passing a URL parameter for a MemberPress login form.

**Thoughts:** My in-trade boss is a hobbyist IT guy but he sure can come up with a doozy of an algorithm!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 37: February 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed While Loop Statements on Automate the Boring Stuff

**Thoughts:** It's interesting to me how loops differ among languages.

**Link to work:** [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/)


### Day 36: February 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Flow Control Statements on Automate the Boring Stuff

**Thoughts:** Again, a nice review.

**Link to work:** [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/)


### Day 35: Feburary 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through Elements of Flow Control on Automate the Boring Stuff

**Thoughts:** I always like to review concepts I already know but I want to watch out for overlearning.

**Link to work:** [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/)


### Day 34: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started chapter 2 on Automate the Boring Stuff

**Thoughts:** I like attacking multiple things at multiple angles. It may take a little longer to get to an educational destination, but I feel a lot more enriched when I get there.

**Link to work:** [Automate the Boring Stuff - Chapter 2](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/)


### Day 33: February 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Created 2 really great Python scripts! My in-trade job wanted to automate creating folders for a list of people and moving/copying MP3 files into the folders. I had to install a library and work with a bunch of tutorials and they work really nicely!

**Thoughts:** This was one of the first times I felt I really had a handle on what I wanted to do and where to look to do it. Growing all the time!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 32: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Skimmed tutorials and articles. Still not fully recovered from travel.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad reading is a good continuance activity!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 31: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Skimmed tutorials and articles in the airport.

**Thoughts:** My husband is not always amused or interested in what I find to read about!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 30: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I spent the morning updating the GSW website to have it ready for our March concert. The direction I got was to make the concert date stand out. It wasn't very specific but I think I made some good choices if a little plain.

**Thoughts:** Studying more current layouts will help with this issue as will getting back to Flatrion schoolwork, where I can get more involved with how to layout in the more current style.

### Day 29: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Skimmed tutorials and articles after the marathon - exhausted!

**Thoughts:** It's not easy to absorb anything when you are overall bone tired!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 28: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I found a fun interactive VIM tutorial! I don't think I rightly absorbed it since I was mainly killing time before going to bed ahead of the Sedona Marathon. I'll have to re-review this!

**Thoughts:** I have been actively avoiding VIM since at least 1995 - it finally found me and it wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would be.

**Link to work:** [Interactive VIM Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)


### Day 27: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Skimmed tutorials and articles

**Thoughts:** Keeping the code study streak going like I do with my running streak - getting at least the minimum!

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 26: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript meetup - chatted with Sarah Rose Battles and assisted with someone's talk that included a demo.

**Thoughts:** I may be an older person in the room but the JS people are really inclusive. I need to embrace that more!

**Link to work:** [JavaScript MN](http://javascriptmn.com/)


### Day 25: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Jumped out on a limb and signed up for Midwest PHP Conference.

**Thoughts:** I'm going in with the small amounts I have learned, but I know I've really enjoyed working with PHP and want to learn more!

**Link to work:**  [Midwest PHP](https://2018.midwestphp.org/)


### Day 24: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Skimmed tutorials and articles

**Thoughts:** It's worth looking around some every day - there's no other way to filter in the information!

**Link to work:** None


### Day 23: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I had been wanting to code along with a Medium article about making your code responsive with one line of CSS, so I did!

**Thoughts:** I was able to play around to create a reasonable facsimile of the original grid the author had as an image in his tutorial, then extend it to work with the images I chose for the final part of the tutorial. Had a brain-freeze on linking a stylesheet - LOL!

**Link to work:** [Hot to make your HTML responsive by adding a single line of CSS](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-html-responsive-by-adding-a-single-line-of-css-2a62de81e431)
[Grid Example](http://callmekko.com/demo/responsive-example/grid.html)


### Day 22: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: My in-trade guy keeps harping on writing Pythons scripts, so I did the research - yep, Python is the best to run on Mac and Win. So I found tutorial with the awesome name "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python". Skimmed through the first couple of chapters to confirm nothing new there, then set up so I could code along the next time I had time.

**Thoughts:** It's nice to know that things are coming into alignment so that I learned or am learning what I need to do what I want to do!

**Link to work:** [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)


### Day 21: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a few more exercises in Python the Hard Way and found a Stack Overflow reference on how to get Git Bash for Windows to run Python in interactive mode. *whew*

**Thoughts:** It's getting easier to find what I'm looking for faster.

**Link to work:** [Python not working in the command line of git bash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32597209/python-not-working-in-the-command-line-of-git-bash)


### Day 20: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Found a tutorial on how to make a JS dropdown menu. I think I have about 90% of it but there were a couple of places where the tutorial author did a } else {...} - not helpful at this stage!!

**Thoughts:** I have started to rubber duck as I re-type others' code so I can really cement the concepts as I go. I still need to fully fix this JS code and find an actual icon for the dropdown arrow - I'm thinking maybe Font Awesome?

**Link to work:** [Nav Bar](https://codepen.io/callmekko/full/zpVgNJ/)


### Day 19: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first WP plugin (basically non-functional but still) and shortcode. Registered my own name as a domain name (finally!)

**Thoughts:** I'm finally digging into the mysteries of WP almost a year after I started in my in-trade job.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 18: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Super-simple HTML for the January race newsletter and got re-started on Python the Hard Way so I can run it side-by-side with Ruby the Hard Way. Can't wait to have time to get back to Flatiron!

**Thoughts:** This little bit of practice daily keeps me focused.

**Link to work:** [January newsletter](http://www.icontact-archive.com/Bm8lHV2mhxDtzhI8enWHlqesNvhA-p96)


### Day 17: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Yeehaw!! I opened up my Flatiron CSS Graffiti Lab and knocked it out in 20 minutes. Then I knocked out CSS Bot in 5 minutes. I'm back!

**Thoughts:** I probably really needed 3 weeks to reset myself. My goal is to shorten up that timeframe in the future - after all, I'll need to be able to solve tougher problems even quicker.

**Link to work:** [Learn.co](https://learn.co)


### Day 16: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent hours messing with pure CSS and Javascript drop-down menus for the GSW site and came up with a handful of nothing. I need more experience before I can find the right solution for this issue. When I pulled myself out of that abyss, I knocked out fixing up some styling issues and updating the JS slider the previous admin located.

**Thoughts:** It's really easy to follow down a bunny path and lose track of the deliverable, even after so many years of managing and project managing. Frankly, without that experience, I may still have been wandering about!

**Link to work:** [GSW (demo site)](http://callmekko.com/demo/gsw/)


### Day 15: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mainly did some reading and skimming, including finding an article on how to set up a local HTTPS server. I need to add that to my task list, together with the MongoDB, HTTP, and mySQL tutorials I researched while on flight delays.

**Thoughts:** I need to read articles more thoroughly and truly understand the underlying principles. This will speed up my knowledge acquistion.

**Link to work:** [HTTPS article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-https-working-on-your-local-development-environment-in-5-minutes-7af615770eec)


### Day 14: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read additional Medium emails.

**Thoughts:** Don't get hung up on all the content I'm missing - read when I can, practice as much as possible.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp on Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/)


### Day 13: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read some articles about CSS that were hanging out in either Twitter threads or Medium emails.

**Thoughts:** There's lots still to learn about CSS but there are also plenty of resources.

**Link to work:** [Ohans Emmanuel on Medium](https://medium.com/@ohansemmanuel)


### Day 12: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed creating customer post types in Elegant Themes. Almost all of the PHP was crystal-clear to me. Simply awesome.

**Thoughts:** The more I practice, the more things become firm in my brain!

**Link to work:** [Custom Post Types in WP](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/creating-custom-post-types-in-wordpress)


### Day 11: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm certain I probably only read something brief to count towards my progress.

**Thoughts:** I need to carve out more specific time daily for code.

**Link to work:** None


### Day 10: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I realized I could export a WP layout to JSON, adjust the appropriate parts of the file and rename it, then import it back in. Voila! Instant new module.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to make more creative connections in solving problems.

**Link to work:** [School of Voiceover](https://www.schoolofvoiceover.com/)


### Day 9: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Oh yeah, CSS sprites! I recalled them from playing in the guts of Weebly before I had enough clues, and I implemented them for the re-tread of the GSW site.

**Thoughts:** I worked and sweated on this, found a couple of different tutorials, and kept going until I solved the problem. I'm getting my mojo back!

**Link to work:** [GSW (demo site)](http://callmekko.com/demo/gsw/)


### Day 8: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided to jump head-first into refactoring the GSW site and not put it off until Sunday. The current domain host is extremely unstable - I was fortunately able to rescue everything via FTP before the site went offline overnight on Friday. Yuck. As I posted to Twitter, my Javascript chops are improving, since I was able to locate the code I wanted based on what I already knew of the DOM and existing functions.

**Thoughts:** I had been very concerned once I learned the site was NOT maintained via a CMS, then realized I was being a silly goose because I had built plenty of sites manually. The JS on the site turned out to be not too scary from a maintenance standpoint, although I could stand to keep leveling up.

**Link to work:** [GSW (demo site)](http://callmekko.com/demo/gsw/)


### Day 7: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got in there and update the MVO website. I had originally wanted to change the template but settled for making some good cosmetic changes to the current. I decided to use the Weebly code module to really style up the content for the next concert - I used a picture of the organ at the next concert venue as the background to the information. I still need W3 schools to remind me how to use transparency but I'm learning.

**Thoughts:** I put things off as if I'm going to magically acquire new knowledge so I can do things. Instead, I need to write down the outcome goal, spend no more than 20 minutes on things hanging me up, and go a different direction if needed.

### Day 6: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: No real strong coding reinforcement today, just reviewing website possibilities with a fellow flute player in my wind ensemble who is my liaison to the board. I was suprised how much knowledge I had restored prior to this conversation - I really felt technical for the first time in a long time.

**Thoughts:** Trust myself, trust the process, keep going!

**Link to work:** None


### Day 5: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mucked around in the PHP of the Wordpress child theme my in-trade job is using, concluded that I would want to look into more of Wordpress' guts before trying anything dramatic. Updated the jQuery written by support to link the name of the school as well as the telephone number that is part of the footer.

**Thoughts:** I learned some refreshing ways to present myself when I start my job search.

**Link to work:** [School of Voiceover](https://www.schoolofvoiceover.com/)


### Day 4: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: In addition to a chapter in Ruby the Hard Way, I attended the Mpls Jr Devs meeting - Ian is one of the founders - really great content, met some new people!

**Thoughts:** I learned some refreshing ways to present myself when I start my job search.

**Link to work:** [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/), [Mpls Jr Devs](http://mplsjrdevs.com/)


### Day 3: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I didn't want to lose momentum, but I also knew I would need about an hour to get back to tackling my Flatiron coursework, so I instead dug up Zed Shaw's "Learn the Hard Way" for Ruby to do some review.

**Thoughts:** I'm working on the spaced repetition aspect of learning by jumping back to Ruby and already I feel a lot faster.

**Link to work:** [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)


### Day 2: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished out Hack the Gap with my team with a third place win!!

**Thoughts:** After getting home late and finishing out my debugging, I was able to assist with some AJAX to get a good working model of our project.

**Link to work:** [y-for-x](https://github.com/IanColdwater/y-for-x)


### Day 1: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Happy birthday to me! Restarting on my birthday at Hack the Gap.

**Thoughts:** I was able to dive in and help with my team project at Hack the Gap, first in creating a mySQL database, then not only writing PHP but also getting to debug! Always remember a new error is better than being stuck!

**Link to work:** [y-for-x](https://github.com/IanColdwater/y-for-x)

# RESTART!

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First day! I read Quincy Larson's article about the challenge on Medium, and decided to go for it!

**Thoughts:** I had been working through the Learn.co curriculum for several weeks and found Ruby to be delightful. I am currently working through the HTML portion of the coursework. I had strong knowledge of HTML and CSS through about 2001 but have found I don't have a ton of catching up to do for HTML5 - yet! Semantic elements are next, and my dabbling hasn't yet strengthened my foundations but the Learn.co curriculum so far has, so I'm excited!

**Link to work:** [Learn.co](https://learn.co/)
