# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mucked around in the PHP of the Wordpress child theme my in-trade job is using, concluded that I would want to look into more of Wordpress' guts before trying anything dramatic. Updated the jQuery written by support to link the name of the school as well as the telephone number that is part of the footer.

**Thoughts:** I learned some refreshing ways to present myself when I start my job search.

**Today's Progress**: In addition to a chapter in Ruby the Hard Way, I attended the Mpls Jr Devs meeting - Ian is one of the founders - really great content, met some new people!

### Day 3: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I didn't want to lose momentum, but I also knew I would need about an hour to get back to tackling my Flatiron coursework, so I instead dug up Zed Shaw's "Learn the Hard Way" for Ruby to do some review.

**Thoughts:** I'm working on the spaced repetition aspect of learning by jumping back to Ruby and already I feel a lot faster.

### Day 2: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished out Hack the Gap with my team with a third place win!!

**Thoughts:** After getting home late and finishing out my debugging, I was able to assist with some AJAX to get a good working model of our project.

### Day 1: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Happy birthday to me! Restarting on my birthday at Hack the Gap.

**Thoughts:** I was able to dive in and help with my team project at Hack the Gap, first in creating a mySQL database, then not only writing PHP but also getting to debug! Always remember a new error is better than being stuck!

# RESTART!

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First day! I read Quincy Larson's article about the challenge on Medium, and decided to go for it!

**Thoughts:** I had been working through the Learn.co curriculum for several weeks and found Ruby to be delightful. I am currently working through the HTML portion of the coursework. I had strong knowledge of HTML and CSS through about 2001 but have found I don't have a ton of catching up to do for HTML5 - yet! Semantic elements are next, and my dabbling hasn't yet strengthened my foundations but the Learn.co curriculum so far has, so I'm excited!
